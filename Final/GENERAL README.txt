General Notes:
1. Basic changes to my DISK_driver.c and .h from assignment 4:
	A. made the structures public (in .h) to be able to access the data directly from the other files.
	B. changed the data interpreter for write so it supports spaces.
	C. made some changes to the write and read functions to fix the bugs.

2. You can compile the file with "make"
3. I have provided separate files for each problem, please use each individual file to teach each problem.
